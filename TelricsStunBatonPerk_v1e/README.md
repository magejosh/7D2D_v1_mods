![I'm in danger Ralph](https://media.tenor.com/sj0E0izDFH0AAAAM/im-in-danger-ralph.gif)

Originally created by [Telric](https://community.7daystodie.com/profile/12164-telric/) in a19 or earlier. Updated to v1.0e by magejosh. Original by Telric only provided the first five books in the perk book series, magejosh felt adding 2 more books so it has 7 like all the other book series. Each of the new books unlocks either a Stun Baton mod that automatically recharges the Stun Baton as long as you are holding it, and the other unlocks a T3 Plasma Baton, with slightly higher attack speed and damage, as well as bonus sneak attack damage.

## Features

* New 7-book long book series full of unlocked abilities and recipes for Stun Baton Lovers
* New Item Mod for Stun Batons
* New T3 Stun Baton
