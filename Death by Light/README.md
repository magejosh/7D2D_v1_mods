Light source blocks raise heatmap strength at an accelerated rate.

## Features

* Increases frequency of heatmpap triggered scout zombie events.

## Technical Details

This modlet uses XPath to modify XML files, and does not require C#.
It does not contain any additional images or Unity assets.
It is safe to install only on the server.

### Roadmap
I need to do some cleanup on this still, and more extensive testing to see performance impact versus gameplay effect.
