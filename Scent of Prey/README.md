![I'm in danger Ralph](https://media.tenor.com/sj0E0izDFH0AAAAM/im-in-danger-ralph.gif)

Makes raw meat and animal fat a dangerous idea. Doing makes you smell like prey, and all the predators and zombies will smell you from farther away and pursue you longer trying to chase your smell.

## Features

* Enables a Smell based approach to survival in regards to food items.

## Technical Details

This modlet uses XPath to modify XML files, and does not require C#.
It does not contain any additional images or Unity assets.
It is safe to install only on the server.

### Roadmap
Ideally I will make tupperware and ziploc bag item versions of the vanilla foods that smell to make them safe to transport.
I will include a compatibility patch for the Food Spoilage mod and this one when I do include the smell safe container items.

Most of the formatting for this `README.md` was written by khzmusic for his Food Spoilage mod and used here for clarity and ease of production. You will be able to find that mod at the following link when he releases it for greater details about that feature specifically: https://gitlab.com/karlgiesing/7d2d-1.0-mods
